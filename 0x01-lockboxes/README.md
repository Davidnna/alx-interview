_0x01-Lockboxes_

You have _n_ number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from _0_ to _n - 1_ and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.<br>

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

- Prototype: _def canUnlockAll(boxes)_
- _boxes_ is a list of lists
- A key with the same number as a box opens that box
- You can assume all keys will be positive integers
	- There can be keys that do not have boxes
- The first box _boxes[0]_ is unlocked
- Return _True_ if all boxes can be opened, else return _False_
